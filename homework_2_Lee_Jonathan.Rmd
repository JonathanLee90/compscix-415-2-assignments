3.2.4  
1. The code shows us a blank canvas.
```{r} 
ggplot(data = mpg)
```

2. There are 234 rows and 11 columns
```{r}
glimpse(mpg)
```

3. The drv variable categorizes the cars into "f" for front-wheel drive, "r" for rear-wheel drive, and "4" for 4-wheel drive.  


4.
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = hwy, y = cyl))
```
5. Plotting this would be not useful as this data would be better arranged in a table. The plot shows points at each type of drive for each class of car. A table can accomplish this task better.
```{r}
ggplot(data=mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = class, y = drv))
```
