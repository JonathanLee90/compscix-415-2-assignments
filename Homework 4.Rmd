* 1. We can take a look at the expected value of each flight delay. So the first scenario would be (-15 * .5) + (15 * .5) = 0. The second scenario would be (1 * 10) = 10. Third scenario would be (-30 * . 5) + (30 * .5) = 0. The final scenario would be (0 * .99) + (120 * .01) = 1.2.

We can also take a look at the mean of each flight's delay.
```{r}
flights %>%
  group_by(flight) %>%
  summarise(delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
```
I'd say arrival delay is more important as a flight can possibly make up the time on the flight to the destination, so the arrival delay is a definite delay of the flight overall while the departure delay could just be a temporary thing,.
